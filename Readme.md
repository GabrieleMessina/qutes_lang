# Qutes Lang
A high level programming language for quantum computing.

## How to Run
```bash
py ./Qutes.py ./GrammarTest.qut
```

### Notes
I'm using [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mike-lischke.vscode-antlr4) antlr VS Code extension to build the grammar and provide the right pip packages to Python source files. 
You can build the grammar in every other way, but you must install the antlr sdk manually if you don't want to use VS Code or the extension. 
In this case, you can follow the official antlr repository [starting guide for Python](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/python-target.md)
