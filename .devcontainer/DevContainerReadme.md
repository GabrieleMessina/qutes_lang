# ‚ö†Ô∏èQutes Lang Developing Container

Thank you for taking some time to look at or help to code Qutes Lang.

Using this container everything should be already in place but, please:
1. **Load the VSCode workspace** to have the right settings for ANTLR;
2. **Make a little change to both qutes_parser.g4 and qutes_lexer.g4** grammar to remember the ANTLR VSCode extension to generate all the files for you.

‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks for your patience, have a nice day üòÄ
