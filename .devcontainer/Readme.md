# Qutes Lang Developing Container

Thank you for taking some time to look at or help to code Qutes Lang.

Using this container everything should be already in place but, please, load the VSCode workspace to have the right settings for ANTLR and then make a little change to qutes_parser.g4 grammar to remember the VSCode extension to generate all the files for you.

Thanks for your patience, have a nice day :)
